# Email Spam Detection System

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project aims to build a robust machine learning model for detecting spam in emails. By leveraging advanced text preprocessing techniques and classification algorithms, the system accurately classifies emails as spam or not spam. A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit allows for easy interaction with the model.
